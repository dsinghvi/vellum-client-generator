LLMs can be used for a wide variety of tasks but they need to be prompted in natural language to produce an output. We’ve found [learnprompting.org](http://learnprompting.org) to be a great resource in ramping up on prompt engineering.

In the list below we’ve shared some “starter” prompt templates, feel free to modify them for your own use cases and remember to use [Vellum’s prompt template syntax](https://www.notion.so/Vellum-Prompt-Template-Syntax-feb9571846894af9a7dfe63cda821ed3?pvs=21) when using our Playground.
